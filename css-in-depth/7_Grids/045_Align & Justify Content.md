# Aligning the grid

Defines how the items are aligned with respect to the grid if the size of all the items combined is not the same size as the container.

```
**justify-content:** baseline | center | end | flex-end | flex-start | 
   left | normal | right | space-around | space-between | space-evenly | start | 
   stretch | safe | unsafe
```
```
**align-content:** baseline | center | end | flex-end | flex-start | 
  left | normal | right | space-between | space-evenly | start | 
  stretch | safe | unsafe
```
Tip: auto track sizes (and only auto track sizes) can be stretched by the align-content and justify-content properties
