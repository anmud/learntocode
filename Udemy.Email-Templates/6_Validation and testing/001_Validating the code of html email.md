# Validating the code of html email

Before we send out our `html email` and before we load this into the third party content management system, we wanna validate our code to make sure it is clean. 

To do his we can use free tool, called [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/). Here we have several options: 

1. we can paste in the `url` if we have the `email` available on e wb server
2. we can upload an `html file`
3. we can use the direct input of the code
