# What is a data type?

A `data type` = is a collection of `related values`.

1. `primitive data types`

Why is it called a primitive data type? It's the simplest data type and it cannot be more simplified
- String -  "abcde"
- Number  -  1,3,4,5,6
- Boolean (true, false)
- undefined / null


2. `complex data types`

Why is it called a complex data type? A complex data type is a container for primitive data types
- Array [1,2,3,4,5] - container for numbers
- Object {a: "string", b: "string"} - container for strings
- Date


What is a `data structure`?

It is a `compositition of other data` types e.g. object or array is also a data structure

```js
var dataStructure = {
  key: [1, 2, 4, 6, 6],
  names: {
    first: "Dimitri",
    last: "Tarasowski"
  },
  phone: 134534534534534 
}
```
