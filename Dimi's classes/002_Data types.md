# What is a data type?

A `data type` = is a collection of `related values`.

1. `primitive data types`
Why is it called a primitive data type? It's the simplest data type and it cannot be more simplified
- String -  "abcde"
- Number  -  1,3,4,5,6
- Boolean (true, false)
- undefined / null


2. `complex data types`
Why is it called a complex data type? A complex data type is a container for primitive data types
- Array [1,2,3,4,5] - container for numbers
- Object {a: "string", b: "string"} - container for strings
- Date
