# Progressive Enhancement

### Enchiridion of HTML/CSS

> **HTML** is about dividing content into blocks (`<div>, <main>, <aside>`), giving these blocks meaning (`<p>,<h1>, <article>`) and using browser API to perform some actions (`<form>, <input>, <textarea>`). 

> **CSS** is about styling these blocks! HTML - markups the text and CSS - styles the text.

> Use **Progressive Enhancement** while designing for web: 
1) Identify core functionality. 
2) Make that functionality available using the simplest possible technology. 
3) Enhance!
