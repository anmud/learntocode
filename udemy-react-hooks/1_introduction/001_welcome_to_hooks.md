# Welcome to Hooks

### What are `React Hooks`?

`React Hooks` provide a new simpler, cleaner way -  both syntactically and logically - write the `react components`. What `hooks` allow us to do is to turn every `react component` into a plain `js function` that just returns JSX. 

So, what exactly are `hooks`? A `hook` is a regular `js function` that hooks into existing `React features`. It allows us to use features (state, context and lifecycle methods) all with the plain `js functions`.

### What are the benefits? 

-  a `reduction in a boilerplate code` as well as in `code size`
-  less complexity
-  easier separation of `business logic` from `components`
-  more reusability, it's much easier to re-use `business logic` from different `components`
