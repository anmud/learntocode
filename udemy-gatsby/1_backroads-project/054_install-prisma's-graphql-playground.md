# Install Prisma's Graphql Playground

One of the options: in the `Gatsby` documentation in the search we can just type `primsas` and we'll see the steps, where we set this up in a `package.json`. However, in our case we'll do it another way - using the plugin - `gatsby-plugin-playground`. 

Install - `npm install --save gatsby-plugin-playground`, and config.
