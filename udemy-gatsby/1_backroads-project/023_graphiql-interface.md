# GraphiQL Interface

GraphiQL is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and
testing GraphQL queries.

- left side - where we are wtiting queries
- right side - we see the response
- our previous queries we can look if press "history" button
- down we have "query variables" part where we can write `variables`

`graphql` is about asking on `specific fields` on the object (then subfilds). As we will gonna be install more and more `plugins` to deal with spacific `data`, let's say `images`, `markdow`, `contentfull` whatever, then with these plugins we are gonna be getting more `fields` - more access to more fields.
