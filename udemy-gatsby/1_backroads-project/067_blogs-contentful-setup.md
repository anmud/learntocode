# Blogs Contentful Setup

First we would need to setup our `data` in the `Contentful`. As our `content field` we can use `rich text` option which gives us wider opportunities to setup our `info`: we can style text as we would like, add `images` and as well add even the `posts` which we have created before. When we would like to get all this `info` via the `query` then this info will be returned as a `JSON object`. Actually, `rich text` content field option gives us the opportunity to work with a text like in a traditional editor.
