# Prisma's Graphql Playground Intro

Well, no to get the `data` and render it in the project we need to access it using qraphql. Well, as usual we use `QrahpiQL` interface to write abd tes our `queries`, but we can also do that in `Prisma's Graphql Playground` - it's just another interface, and queries are not gonna change. Why we use `Prisma's Graphql Playground`?

- it has a nice option of creating a tab
- their documentation is a bit smoother than the `QrahpiQL`
