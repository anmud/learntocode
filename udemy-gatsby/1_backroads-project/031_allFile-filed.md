# **allFile** Filed

Let's try to get it in the `graphiQl`. The very important filed here will be  -  `edges`. What are the `edges` - every time with gatsby we are gonna be dealing with the list of things (tha could be JSON files, images, contentful information...), and then from this `edges` filed you'll gonna be looking for more spesific item. So, every time you'll gonna have a `list` you'll gonna go for the `edges` field and then within the `edges` we'll have more options. 
One more important filed - within the `edjes` - is `node`. `Node` will be an object that represents each and every item.
