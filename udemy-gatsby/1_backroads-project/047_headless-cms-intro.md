# Headless CMS Intro

So, how we are going to setup our `data` externally? We would use smth. called `Headless CMS`. `Headless CMS` is a backend only CMS, it is build as `content repository`, it provides a nice graphical interface to manage our `content` and makes `content` accessible the `restfull API`. What makes it really cool is the fact that we can display the same `data` on any device or frontend. And we don't need to change the way the `data` is stored or `content type` of our `data`. 

> The `Headless CMS` has only one focus - storing and delivering the structured content.
