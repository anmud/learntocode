# Styled Components Intro

On our main page we gonna have the `section` "About us" as well as `services` section. Each of these sections have `title` component. What special about this - for the `title` we will use `styled components`. 
For the `backgrounds` we will use the `Gatsby plugin` (gatsby-background-image) special for the `backgrounds` - and this particular plugin is using `styled components`. 

To use `styled components` we need to install a plugin (gatsby-plugin-styled-components) and do our setyp in `gatsby-config` file. 

Advantages: 
- it will be dynamic
- it will be optimized (our site will still load extreemly fast even though we have massive images )
