# Contentfull Intro

For our project we'll use (Contentful)[https://www.contentful.com/resources/download-ebook/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search-paid&utm_campaign=brand&utm_content=e-book&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxcuh8tiY5AIVleh3Ch0F4gYoEAAYAiAAEgLsU_D_BwE] as our `Headless cms`. 

The `Contentful` has a free option, very straightforward interface and easy setup, as well as it plays nice with `Netlify`. 

First we need to register for free and then we can create a new `space` for the project. There are two very important tabs in the `Contentful` interface: 
- content model. We can think of `model` as the `structure` of our `data`. The `Content model` describes the `data` that we gonna be adding. We are not limited to just one `content model` we can setup as many as we want. When we are triyng to access the `content` we need the `id` 
- content. If we have our `content model` we can just start adding pieces of `data`.

If you would like to setup the API keys, you just need to go to the `settings` and within it you have an option to create the API key.
