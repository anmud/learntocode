# Difference btw Arguments and Parameters

`Arguments` and `parameters` are different. They are not interchangable. 
`Parameters` are just placeholders, they are like `variables`, they hold `values`. BUT before the `call-time` they have no `value`, they are unefined. The way they get values - if you pas them `arguments`. And here the order is super important, so the code knows which `argument` goes to which `parameter`.
