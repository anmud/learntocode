# Coinbase clone

So, we are trying to clone `coinbase` with `tailwind`. Firt we have the `div` which holds the `background color`, within this `div` we have another `div` which is a container, and within the `container` we have a `div` which holds `flex items` inside. 

For the `mobile version` we have our `nav hamburger menu`, but we hide it for the bigger sizes.
