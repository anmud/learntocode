# Flex Direction

The **flex-direction** property is used to specify the direction in which the elements of `flex container` (`flex-items`) are needed to be placed.

```css
flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse
```

This property accepts four values:

- **row** − Arranges the elements of the container horizontally from left to right.

- **row-reverse** − Arranges the elements of the container horizontally from right to left.

- **column** − Arranges the elements of the container vertically from left to right.

- **column-reverse** − Arranges the elements of the container vertically from right to left.
