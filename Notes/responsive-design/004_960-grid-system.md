# 960 Grid Sydtem - 12 columns

![960-grid](./960-grid.png)

There is a lot of flexibility of how many `columns` can be there. To understand the `column system`  - each of these `columns` is the **allocated width** for containing `content`. 

- In this case it allows us 12 columns, each column has got a gutter on each side. Each column is` 60 px` wide - and then the space - `10 px` on each side. 

`gutter + column + gutter = 80 px column`

- If we go across the screen - if we only putting the content on the columns and leaving the gutter on each side as the clear space - then the maximum that we can use is - `940px`.

- two columns will be `140px` wide
