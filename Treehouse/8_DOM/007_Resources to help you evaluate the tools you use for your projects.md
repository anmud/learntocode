**Babel**
Many JavaScript developers turn to tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to manage the varying stages of browser support for new JS features. Babel can be used for other environments besides browsers too. Check out [Introduction to Babel on Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-babel) for help getting set up with this great tool. 


**Mozilla Developer Network**
Here is the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), or MDN's main page. This is a great reference site for JavaScript, as well as the browser environment.
