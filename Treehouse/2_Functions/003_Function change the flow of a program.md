# Functions change the flow of a program

The programs we write start at the top of the file and run line by line to the end of the file. `Functions` break this top-to-buttom `flow`. 

It's very common to have one `function` to cal another `function` which calls one more `function`. As each `function` completes it returns to the `function` that called it. That's the one reason - it's a good idea to put your functions togethter at the top of the script.

So, those different components you access in your program are organized in a single area of the script.
