# Planning the Next Steps

Now it's logical to finish the `Portfolio` and `Stocks` parts of our application, so that we can see what features these `components` will have in the end, so we could then decide how we should manage the `state` for that and so on. Therefore what we will work on next is the `Stocks` component, which includes not only the grid of stocks but also `individual stock`. 

Well, let's keep in mind that `Stoks.vue` is the grid for the stocks and the `individual Stock` has features like the `name of the stock`, `price`. And we also need to take into account that we want to have the `input field` and a `buy button` and of course we only want to user buy if the `input field` is not empty and if a valid `number` was entered and if the number was greater than `0`.
