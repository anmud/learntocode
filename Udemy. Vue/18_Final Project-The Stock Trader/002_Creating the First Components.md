# Creating the First Components

Let's start from creating the main `components`, for that we'll first create the `components folder`. In this `components folder` we'll have a `Home.vue` file, a `Header.vue` file. And then in the `components folder` we'll create some subfulders: the first `portfolio` and the second we'll name `stocks`. In the `portfolio folder` we gonna create a `Portfolio.vue` file and also `Stock.vue` file for the individual stock we'll have on our `portfolio page`. In the `stock folder` we'll create `Stocks.vue` file and `Stock.vue` file for the individual stok too.  The two `Stock.vue` files will have some shared code.

Well, with the `components` in place first let's mark them: give them `templates`, `scripts`, some `headings`.
