# Add a Firebase Project

In this module we'll see how we can use an `additional package` to validate the data the user enters in the input filed. We'll use `additional package` cos VueJS doesn't offer it itself. 

Make sure to set up a `Firebase project` where you enable `Email/ Password authentication` and use your `API key + Firebase REST endpoints` to follow along in this module.

You learn how to set up these things in the `Auth course module`. You don't need to complete the Auth module to be able to then proceed with this module. Just make sure that `Firebase` is set up and connected correctly.
