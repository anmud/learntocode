# Alternative Folder Structures

There's also an alternative you might want to consider.

Instead of having your components in a components/ folder (and storing other shared files in other folders - e.g. shared/), you can also group your files by feature.

This could look like this:

- main.js
- users/
- - account/
- - analytics/
- shop
- - main/
- - checkout/
