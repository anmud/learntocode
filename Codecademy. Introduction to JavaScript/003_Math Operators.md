# Math Operators

Don't worry! Math doesn't need to be your strong-suit to learn JavaScript. However, there are operators you'll need to know to make useful programs.

JavaScript supports the following math operators:

* Add: +
* Subtract: -
* Multiply: *
* Divide: /

These all work how you might guess:

```js
console.log(3 + 4); // Equals 7
console.log(5 - 1); // Equals 4
console.log(4 * 2); // Equals 8
console.log(9 / 3); // Equals 3
```
In the example above, each line uses a different mathematical operator to log a value to the console.
