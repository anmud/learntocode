# Console

Before you learn about data types and methods, you need to know how to print values to the console. The console is a tool that developers use to record the output of their JavaScript programs.

The `console.log()` command is used to print, or log, text to the console. Consider the following example:

`console.log("Hello!");`

In this example, Hello! is logged to the console. Notice, we denote the end of the line with a semicolon. Although your code will usually run as intended without a semicolon, it is best practice to always include one to ensure your code works as expected in situations when it does need one.
