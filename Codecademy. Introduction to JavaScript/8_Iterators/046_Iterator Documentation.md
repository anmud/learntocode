# Iterator Documentation

There are many additional built-in array methods, a complete list of which is on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

The documentation for each method contains several sections:

1. A short definition
2. A block with the correct syntax for using the method
3. A list of parameters the method accepts or requires
4. The return value of the function
5. An extended description
6. Examples of the method's use
7. Polyfill, Specifications, Browser Compatibility

A list of iterator methods can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Iteration_methods).
