# Undefined

What happens if you create a variable, but don't assign it a value?

JavaScript creates space for this variable in memory and sets it to undefined. Undefined is the fifth and final primitive data type. JavaScript assigns the undefined data type to variables that are not assigned a value.

`let whatAmI;`

In the example above, we created the variable `whatAmI` without any value assigned to it. JavaScript creates the variable and sets it equal to the value undefined.
