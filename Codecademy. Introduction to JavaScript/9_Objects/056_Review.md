# Review: Objects

Way to go! Let's review what we learned in this lesson:

* Objects store key-value pairs and let us represent real-world things in JavaScript.
* Properties in objects are separated by commas. Key-value pairs are always separated by a colon.
* You can add or edit a property within an object with dot notation.
* A method is a function in an object.
* `this` helps us with scope inside of object methods. `this` is a dynamic variable that can change depending on the object that is calling the method.
* `Getter` and `setter` methods allow you to process data before accessing or setting property values.
